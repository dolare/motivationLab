Charitable is a powerful, extendable fundraising plugin that gives you full control over your website donations. 

== Description ==

**[Charitable](https://www.wpcharitable.com/?utm_source=readme&utm_medium=description-tab&utm_content=intro&utm_campaign=plugin-page-referrals)** is the WordPress Fundraising Toolkit. It's a robust, developer-friendly plugin that gives you complete control over your online fundraising.

= Easy to use =

Install, activate and create your first fundraising campaign in less than 5 minutes. With Charitable, adding campaigns is a straightforward, intuitive process. Less time setting up campaigns means more time for you to raise awareness for your campaign.

= Payment gateway support = 

PayPal and offline donations are supported out of the box. When you're ready to start accepting donations through a different payment gateway, you can choose one of our premium gateway add-ons: 

* **[Stripe](https://www.wpcharitable.com/extensions/charitable-stripe?utm_source=readme&utm_medium=description-tab&utm_content=extensions&utm_campaign=plugin-page-referrals)**
* **[Authorize.Net](https://www.wpcharitable.com/extensions/charitable-authorize-net?utm_source=readme&utm_medium=description-tab&utm_content=extensions&utm_campaign=plugin-page-referrals)**
* **[PayUMoney](https://www.wpcharitable.com/extensions/charitable-payu-money/?utm_source=readme&utm_medium=description-tab&utm_content=extensions&utm_campaign=plugin-page-referrals)** -- Indian payment gateway
* **[PayFast](https://www.wpcharitable.com/extensions/charitable-payfast/?utm_source=readme&utm_medium=description-tab&utm_content=extensions&utm_campaign=plugin-page-referrals)** -- South African payment gateway

Need a payment gateway that wasn't listed? [Let us know](https://www.wpcharitable.com/support?utm_source=readme&utm_medium=description-tab&utm_content=credit-card-donations&utm_campaign=plugin-page-referrals).

= Use Peer-to-Peer Fundraising to expand your reach = 

With our [Charitable Ambassadors extension](https://www.wpcharitable.com/extensions/charitable-ambassadors?utm_source=readme&utm_medium=description-tab&utm_content=peer-to-peer-fundraising&utm_campaign=plugin-page-referrals), you can use peer-to-peer fundraising to leverage your supporters’ network of friends and family. 

Ambassadors adds a frontend campaign submission form. People can create fundraisers for your cause or personal causes, allowing you to create a crowdfunding platform powered by Charitable Ambassadors.

= Skip the transaction fees = 

Other fundraising software charges you for every donation you receive. 

Charitable is different. We won't charge you any transaction fees and you can use Charitable for free.

= Unlimited fundraising campaigns = 

You can set up as many campaigns as you'd like with Charitable, and you can tailor them to your needs. You can set up suggested donation amounts, allow them to donate as much as they want, or do both.

Need to set a fundraising goal? No problem. 

Running a time-sensitive campaign? Set an end date for your campaign and give it a sense of urgency.

= Works with any theme = 

Charitable has been designed to work with any well-coded theme, including the default WordPress themes.

= Extensions = 

One size does *not* fit all. That's why we made Charitable an extendable platform.

= I don't want to send my donors to PayPal. How can I accept donations right on my site? =

You can accept donations with the Offline Donations gateway, which allows your donors to create a donation and make the payment via cheque or bank transfer (you can display your payment details to them).

You can also accept credit card donations with the [Stripe extension](https://www.wpcharitable.com/extensions/charitable-stripe?utm_source=readme&utm_medium=faq-tab&utm_content=avoid-paypal&utm_campaign=plugin-page-referrals). If you want to use a different payment gateway, [let us know](https://www.wpcharitable.com/support?utm_source=readme&utm_medium=faq-tab&utm_content=avoid-paypal&utm_campaign=plugin-page-referrals).

= How do I add a grid of campaigns to my page? = 

Easy. Just add `[campaigns]` into your page content. [Read more](https://www.wpcharitable.com/documentation/the-campaigns-shortcode?utm_source=readme&utm_medium=faq-tab&utm_content=campaigns-shortcode&utm_campaign=plugin-page-referrals).

= Does Charitable support recurring donations? =

Yes. Recurring donations support is possible with our [Recurring Donations extension](https://www.wpcharitable.com/extensions/charitable-recurring-donations/?utm_source=readme&utm_medium=faq-tab&utm_campaign=recurring-donations).

= How do I get support? =

* We cleaned up another bug involving our [Easy Digital Downloads Connect extension](https://www.wpcharitable.com/extensions/charitable-easy-digital-downloads-connect/?utm_source=readme&utm_medium=changelog-tab&utm_campaign=edd-connect), which resulted in being unable to set an end date for contribution rules when the campaign doesn't have an end date.

* If you were using our [Easy Digital Downloads Connect extension](https://www.wpcharitable.com/extensions/charitable-easy-digital-downloads-connect/?utm_source=readme&utm_medium=changelog-tab&utm_campaign=edd-connect) and your site language is not English, you may have had problems with end dates for your benefactor relationships not saving correctly. We've fixed up that bug now. [#305](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/305)

= 1.4.11 =

= 1.4.10 = 
* Correctly filter donations by date in the CSV export. This was broken in certain non-English languages. [#299](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/299)

= 1.4.9 =

= 1.4.8 = 
* Removed some code left over from plugin testing.

= 1.4.7 =

* Show a blank field for formatted addresses in the donation export or admin donation pages when no address details were provided. Previously, the donor's name was shown. [#255](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/255) and [#256](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/256)
* Fix client-side credit card validation. [#280](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/280)

= 1.4.6 =
* Properly activate Charitable on all sites when it is network activated. Also makes sure that Charitable is correctly installed when a new site is added to a network that has Charitable network-activated. [#225](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/225)
* Display success messages to the user after settings are updated in the admin. [#54](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/54)
* Fixes a bug that prevented donations from being displayed in the admin when filtering by campaign. [#242](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/242)
* Removes PHP warnings that were displayed on the Charitable donations page in the dashboard when there are no donations. [#232](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/232)
* Changed the hook that the Donation Receipt and Donation Notification emails are sent on from `save_post` to `charitable-completed_donation`. [#217](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/217)
* Added a `CHARITABLE_DEBUG` constant for error logging. Currently, enabling this only logs the IPN responses that are received from PayPal after donations are made. [#229](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/229)
* Ensure that the donation form script is always loaded for the campaign donation widget. [#239](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/239)
* Fixes a bug that prevented the password reset from working correctly. [#238](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/238)
* Refer to campaigns as campaigns instead of posts in admin update messages. [#234](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/234)

= 1.4.5 =
* The permissions for accessing Donations and Campaigns in the WordPress dashboard has changed. Users who are set up as Campaign Managers can access both Donations and Campaigns, but cannot access Charitable settings. This permission is reserved for admin users. In addition, the `manage_charitable_settings` permission has been removed from Campaign Managers. [#209](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/209)
* Fixes the way donations are processed in Javascript to avoid issues when the donation is *not* processed with AJAX (currently, this is only the case if you're using the Easy Digital Downloads extension, Pronamic iDEAL or an old version of one of our premium payment gateway extensions). [#223](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/223)
* Fixes the registration form shortcode, which was being printed out too early on the page. [#224](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/224)
* Adds a new filter for the list of active payment gateways: `charitable_active_gateways`. See `Charitable_Gateways::get_active_gateways()`.
* Three new methods have been added to the `Charitable_Donation` abstract class: `get_donation_type()` retrieves the type of donation; `get_donation_plan_id()` returns the ID of the recurring donation plan (to be used by the Recurring Donations extension); `get_donation_plan()` returns the recurring donation object. [PR #215](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/pull/215)
* Export files now include the type of export (note: this does not work if you are on PHP 5.2). [#200](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/200)
* The `custom` parameter for PayPal donations now accepts a JSON string. [PR #198](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/pull/198)

= 1.4.4 =
* Resolves a new issue related to the donation form validation introduced in version 1.4.3, which prevented the donation widget form from being submitted. [#221](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/204) and [#205](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/221)
* Fixes a bug that resulted in logged in users who had never made a donation being able to see a list of all donations with the `[charitable_my_donations]` shortcode. No personal donor data was displayed, and the donation receipts remained inaccessible to the users. All they could see was the date of the donation, the campaign donated to and the amount of the donation. [#220](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/204) and [#205](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/220)

= 1.4.3 = 
* Added a new sandbox testing tool to allow you to test your PayPal donation flow. If you're using PayPal, you should test this as soon as you can to avoid disruption, as PayPal is making some security upgrades to its platform which may cause problems for certain sites. [Read more about how PayPal's upgrades will affect you](https://www.wpcharitable.com/how-paypals-ssl-certificate-upgrade-will-affect-you-and-how-you-can-prepare-for-it/?utm_source=notice&utm_medium=wordpress-dashboard&utm_campaign=paypal-ssl-upgrade&utm_content=blog-post)
* Added honeypot form validation for the donation form and registration, password reset, forgot password and profile forms. This is an anti-spam measure designed to prevent fake donations from being created by bots.
* Prevent donations from being created if an invalid email address or payment gateway is used. 
* Ensure that client-side validation is always performed for donations, even when the gateway integration has not been updated for compatibility with the AJAX-driven donations introduced in version 1.3. The only gateway that we know of that falls into this category is Pronamic iDEAL, so this is a nice update if you are using Pronamic iDEAL.

= 1.4.2 =
* Added a link to the registration form from the login form and vice versa. [#204](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/204) and [#205](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/205)
* Included two new parameters in the `[charitable_registration]` shortcode: `redirect` sets the default page that people should be redirect to after registering, and `login_link_text` sets the text of the login link (see above). [#208](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/208) and [#205](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/205)
* Also included a new parameter in the `[charitable_login]` shortcode: `registration_link_text` sets the text of the login link (see above). [#204](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/204)
* Added a column for the campaign creator to the campaigns page in the WordPress dashboard. [#166](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/166)
* Added three new fields that can be displayed in donation-related emails, like the donation receipt or admin notification: the total amount donated, the campaign(s) that received the donation and the categories of the campaign(s) that received the donation. [#202](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/202) and [#203](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/203)
* Made sure that setting the `order` parameter in the `[campaigns]` shortcode works with lowercase and uppercase. `ASC`, `DESC`, `asc` and `desc` are all valid options now. [#206](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/206)
* Fixed a bug that prevented the campaign end date from saving when using Charitable in a non-English installation. [#201](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/201)
* Fixed a bug that prevented the comments section from appearing on campaigns when modal donations were enabled. [#210](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/210)
* Fixed a bug that caused a PHP warning when trying to use the `site_url` email shortcode parameter in emails.

= 1.4.1 = 
* The donor address is split over multiple columns in the donation export. [#194](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/194)
* In certain cases, credit card validation was getting triggered for non-credit card donations (i.e. PayPal or Offline). This bug has been fixed. [#189]((https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/189)
* After a donor makes a successful donation is made, their session is cleared as expected. [#181]((https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/181)
* Pending and draft campaigns are now included in the filtering options on the Donations page. [#187]((https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/187)
* The Bolivian Boliviano currency (BOB) has been added. [#193]((https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/193)

= 1.4.0 =
* Added the `[charitable_my_donations]` shortcode. Use this shortcode to allow logged in users to view a history of their donations, including links to the donation receipts. [#14](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/14)
* Scale the campaign grid gracefully when viewing on smaller screens. The `[campaigns]` shortcode now supports a `responsive` paramater, which is enabled by default. You can set it to a specific px/em amount to change the breakpoint, or set it to `0` to disable responsive styling. [#88](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/88)
* Also provided appropriately responsive styling for suggested donation amounts on small screens. [#159](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/159)
* Added client-side validation for the donation form. This checks whether donors have filled out all the required fields, whether they're donating more than $0 (because seriously, a $0 donation won't go far :)) and whether they have used a valid credit card (if you're using our Stripe or Authorize.Net extensions). [#176](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/176) and [#63](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/63)
* Added a password reset process to provide a complete user-facing login and registration workflow. [#89](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/89)
* Include an `order` paramater for the `[campaigns]` shortcode, to reverse the direction in which campaigns are displayed. [#64](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/64)
* Allow campaigns in the `[campaigns]` shortcode to be ordered by any of the orderby options for [`WP_Query`](https://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Query#Order_.26_Orderby_Parameters).
* Added drag and drop support for the Picture form field, which is used in the User Avatar and Ambassadors extensions. [#111](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/111)
* Improved how the plugin checks for updates to Charitable extensions, to keep the WordPress dashboard running smoothly. [#133](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/133)
* Added a `charitable_create_donation()` function for developers who want to create donations programatically. [#109](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/109)
* Added a new `Charitable_Donations_Query` class, which can be used by developers to retrieve donations from the database. [#155](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/155)
* Added a new `Charitable_Deprecated` class, which is used to record any incorrect usage of Charitable functions or methods.
* Switched to using the built-in edit.php admin page for listing Charitable donations, instead of relying on a custom admin page with a custom posts table. While there, we also simplified the interface and added colour-coding to the donation statuses. [#110](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/110)
* Include the donor's phone number, address and the payment method in the donations export CSV. [#154](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/154)
* When multiple gateways are enabled, the default one is listed first in the donation form. [#139](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/139)
* Automatically cancel a donation when the donor returns from the gateway before completing it. This works with PayPal, PayUMoney and PayFast. [#90](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/90) and [#117](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/117)
* Added a `Charitable_Donor::__toString()` method, so that echoing the object simply prints out the donor name.
* Added `charitable_sanitize_amount()` function to convert any amount of type string into a float.
* Trim the currency symbol from monetary amounts to prevent the symbol being treated as part of the amount. [#145](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/pull/145)
* Trim the currency symbol from the suggested donation amounts when saving a campaign. [#147](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/147)
* When a donation fails and the user is redirected back to the donation form, they can re-attempt the same donation. Previously, a new donation would have been created, leaving a phantom pending donation behind. [#106]
(https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/106)
* Prevent duplicate donations caused by clicking the donate button repeatedly. [#164]
(https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/164)
* Fixed a bug related to empty content in the Layers theme. [#9](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/9)

= 1.3.7 = 
* Makes `Charitable_Currency::get_currency_symbol()` a publicly accessible method.
* Allow email shortcode values to be dynamically generated without being registered first. This simplifies the process of displaying dynamic data within emails if there is no existing shortcode output for it. [#134](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/134)
* Provide a consistent api for determining the status of a campaign. Developers can use `$campaign->get_status_key()` (where `$campaign` is a `Charitable_Campaign` object) to check whether a campaign is inactive, ended, ended and successfully funded, ended and not successfully funded, ending soon, or active. 
* Reset the positioning and styling of the modal when window or modal change in size. This prevents the modal from growing larger than the size of the window without having scrollbars. [#135](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/135)

= 1.3.6 = 
* Prevented campaigns being created with no suggested donation amounts and custom donations disabled. This results in $0 donations. [#127](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/127)
* Fixed errors when exporting donations with errors set to display. [#128](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/128)
* Deprecated `Charitable_Email::return_value_if_has_valid_donation()` method, since this was completely broken and should not be used.

= 1.3.5 =
* Added `is_preview()` method to `Charitable_Email` class. 
* Added `get_donations()` method to `Charitable_Donor` class.
* Improved custom post status labels.
* Only include completed payments in the Donation Statistics dashboard widget, for the period summaries. 
* Fixed PHP notices in email previews.
* Deprecated `Charitable_Session::get_session_id()`. We are no longer using a public session ID.

= 1.3.4 =
* Added selective refresh support for Charitable widgets.
* Added support for passing multiple campaign IDs to campaign donation queries. [#112](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/112)
* Fixed a bug where donors without a completed donation were included in the donor count in the Donation Stats widget. [#114](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/114)
* Fixed a bug that incorrectly set the from address for emails to always be the site email address, instead of using the provided settings. [#113](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/113)
